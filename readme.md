- mail: cotitan@outlook.com

### Requirments, * means not necessary
- pytorch==0.4.0
- numpy==1.12.1+
- python==3.5+
- word2vec==0.10.2*
- allennlp==0.8.2*

### Data
Training and evaluation data for Gigaword is available https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6N7tANPyVeBNmlSX19Ld2xDU1E

Training and evaluation data for CNN/DM is available https://s3.amazonaws.com/opennmt-models/Summary/cnndm.tar.gz

### Noticement
1. we use another thread to preprocess a batch of data, which would not terminate after the main process terminate. So you need to press ctrl+c again to terminate the thread.
